-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=drawing-colour---youtube>Drawing Colour - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#drawing-colour---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l6xpHqcDL2M/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.82ungmDzOVpDK69f9I0f5AHaEK&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Drawing colour - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cool wallpapers for different devices:
